# OD - Your Virtual Assistant 🤖

Welcome to the **OD Virtual Assistant** repository! 🎉 This project showcases a sophisticated virtual assistant designed for interactive user engagement, allowing users to communicate effortlessly through voice commands.

## Project Overview 📚

This repository contains:
- **HTML** and **CSS** structure for the user interface implementation 🌐
- **JavaScript** logic for processing voice commands and providing responses 🔍
- A feature set that allows users to open websites and check the time/date 🕒


## Understanding OD Virtual Assistant 🤔

**OD** is designed to assist users by executing commands through voice interaction. It can respond to greetings, open websites, and provide the current time and date. 

### How OD Works 🔄

The virtual assistant follows these steps:
1. Listens for user commands through a voice activation button.
2. Processes the commands and responds accordingly.
3. Utilizes JavaScript functions to perform various tasks, like opening websites and providing time/date information.

### Example Commands 🗣️

Here are some example commands you can use with OD:
- **Greetings**: 
  - "hello"
  - "how are you"
- **Opening Websites**: 
  - "open google"
  - "open youtube"
- **Time and Date**: 
  - "time"
  - "date"

## JavaScript Implementation 💻

Here’s a core JavaScript function for processing user commands:

```javascript
function handleCommand(command) {
    // Process user command and respond accordingly
    switch(command.toLowerCase()) {
        case "hello":
            return "Hello! I'm OD, your virtual assistant.";
        case "how are you":
            return "I am OD, I am your virtual assistant created by Muhammad Eshareeb Rajput.";
        case "time":
            return new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
        case "date":
            return new Date().toLocaleDateString();
        // Additional cases for opening websites...
        default:
            return "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.";
    }
}

// Example usage:
console.log(handleCommand("hello")); // "Hello! I'm OD, your virtual assistant."
```
